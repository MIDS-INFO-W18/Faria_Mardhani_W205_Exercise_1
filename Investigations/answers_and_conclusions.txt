Approach and Conclusion:

Which Hospitals are Models of High-Quality Care?

In order to determine which hospitals are models of high-quality care, we used the dataset called "timely and effective care" which provides scoring for several procedures performed at hospitals across the country. The procedures measured in this dataset include timeliness of care in acute situations (heart attack, stroke), as well as the percentage of patients who receive effective care in a timely manner for a range of conditions. The timeliness and effectiveness of each of these measures can have different units - either minutes (of waiting), percentage of patients, or the number of patients. Of all of the procedures in the dataset, 21 had definitions in the data dictionary online. Of those, we deemed 16 to be reasonable measures of care quality. We excluded certain measures that were more correlated with a hospital's/town's size than with it's quality of care, such as the total volume of patients at the emergency department. Of the 16 measures we deemed reasonable, there were 3 which were not present in the given dataset. Ultimately we used 13 measures to rank hospital quality. 


In order to rank each hospital, we used the following approach:

For each measure, we ranked the hospitals by their scores in ascending or descending order (based on whether the score was a positive sign if it was higher or lower). The procedures we measured as well as their order (ascending/descending) can be found in the measures_defninition.csv file under the Investigations directory. We limited the ranking for each measure to 10 hospitals. The hospital in the top ranking would receive 10 points, the following one would receive 9, continuing down the list, and the last one would receive 1 point. In some measures, several hospitals performed equally well, in which case we provided the same amount of points to each hospital. In the end, we aggregated the points for each hospital across all 13 measures, and ranked the hospitals by these composite scores.

Based on the analysis above, we found that the following 10 hospitals modeled high-quality care based on the measures we studied. Below you can see the provider IDs, names, and composite scores of these hospitals:

520008  WAUKESHA MEMORIAL HOSPITAL      10


Which States are Models of High-Quality Care?

In order to determine which states are models of high-quality care, we used the same approach described above for hospitals, except we used the average score for the state (average score of all hospitals in the state) for each measure. We created state rankings for all 13 measures, and ultimately created a composite score for each state and a final ranking of the top 10 states which modeled high-quality care. You can see the states which modeled the highest quality care and their composite scores below:

UT      53
SD      42
ME      40
KS      39
NE      38
MT      38
NH      37
WI      35
WY      33
CO      30

Which Procedures have the Highest Variability between Hospitals?

In order to determine which procedures have the highest variability between hospitals, we took our "scores" table which contained the "timely and effective care" data and filtered on the table for all 13 of the procedures that we decided to study in this project. For each of the procedures, we created a separate table of the scores assigned to each hospital which has performed it, and calculated the variance of those scores. You can find the procedures with the highest variances and their variances below:

ED1     8617.740839212507
ED2     3864.6924460743544
OP 18   1656.5529409803205
Median Time to Transfer to Another Facility for Acute Coronary Intervention     869.0306968514053

Head CT results 477.18888614639235
Fibrinolytic Therapy Received Within 30 Minutes Of Hospital Arrival     352.6666666666667
Fibrinolytic Therapy Received Within 30 Minutes of ED Arrival   325.74632352941165
Median time to pain med 314.0819735739413
Door to diagnostic eval 285.00371267017476

Are Average Scores for Hospital Quality Correlated with Patient Survey Responses?

In order to determine the correlation with patient survey responses, we compared our top 10 hospitals which model high-quality care against the top 10 rated hospitals according to patient responses. In the table below, you will find the provider ID, hospital name, composite score, and survey patient response score for the top 10 hospitals based on our analysis. As you can see, the top 10 hospitals based on our analysis do not have high patient response scores for the most part. This is probably due to the fact that our analysis is based on measures related to the hospital's ability to respond quickly and treat certain conditions, whereas the survey focused on different kinds of questions - such as cleanliness and communication. This tells us that even though a hospital performs well on certain procedures, it doesn't necessarily have an environment or staff that the patients appreciate.
